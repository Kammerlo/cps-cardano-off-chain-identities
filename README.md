## Abstract

The Cardano blockchain is a platform for complex, high-value transactions and decentralized applications. 
These transactions often involve multiple parties, including individuals, organizations, and smart contracts.
To facilitate these interactions, it is essential to have a reliable way to verify the identities of participants.
While Cardano's on-chain data model provides a robust framework for transaction verification, it lacks a standardized mechanism for off-chain identity verification.
This limitation makes it difficult to verify the identity of participants, establish trust, and comply with regulatory requirements. 
While several off-chain identity solutions exist, there is no universally accepted standard on Cardano, leading to a fragmented and insecure ecosystem. 
This problem statement outlines the need for a standardized solution for off-chain identity verification on Cardano to enhance trust, security, and adoption.

## Problem

The core problem is the absence of a standardized, selfsustaining and user-friendly solution for linking off-chain identifiers to on-chain transaction on the Cardano blockchain. 
This problem has several negative impacts:
- Lack of Trust and Security: Without a reliable way to verify the identity of participants, it is difficult to establish trust and prevent fraud. This is a major barrier to adoption for applications that require a high degree of security, such as financial services and enterprise applications.
- Poor User Experience: Users are forced to manage multiple identities across different applications, leading to a confusing and frustrating experience.
- Limited Interoperability: The lack of a standardized approach makes it difficult for different applications to share identity information, limiting the potential for compatibility and innovation.
- Compliance Challenges: The absence of a clear identity verification framework makes it difficult for businesses and organizations to comply with regulatory requirements, such as KYC and AML.

## Goals

The goal of this problem statement is to initiate a discussion within the Cardano community about the need for a standardized framework for off-chain identity verification. 
The ultimate objective is to develop a solution that:
- Is secure and trustworthy: The solution should provide a high degree of security and be resistant to fraud and manipulation.
- Is self-sustaining: The solution should be able to operate independently of any single entity or organization, ensuring decentralization and resilience.
- Is interoperable: The solution should be compatible with a wide range of applications and services. (For example easy to integrate into existing solutions, like explorers, wallets, and dApps.)
- Is compliant with regulations: The solution should help businesses and organizations to comply with relevant regulations.

By addressing this problem, we can enhance the trust, security, and adoption of the Cardano blockchain, and unlock its full potential as a platform for decentralized innovation.
